## How will you use the Twitter API or Twitter data
To develop Japan Mask Map.
http://www.japanmaskmap.com

Due to the spread of corona virus, mask stock in Japan is limited. Taiwan already have public website to visualize mask stock in each store.

Unfortunately Japanese government doesn't have mask API.
That's why I need Twitter API to get tweets from the official store accounts.

## Please describe how you will analyze Twitter data including any analysis of Tweets or Twitter users.

Get tweets from official store accounts.
If they say start selling of masks, I will update my website data to stock available.
If they say all masks are sold, I will update my website data to out of stock.

## Please describe your planned use of these features
Basically only Tweet is needed for mask map because that's the place information is embedded. Like and follow might be useful to detect official store accounts.

## Please describe how and where Tweets and/or data about Twitter content will be displayed outside of Twitter.
Only parsed data will be displayed to my website.
Current plan is number of stock of masks based on size.

Since tweet link exists, the users can check the source of information.


## Please list all government entities you intend to provide Twitter content or derived information to under this use case

Currently not planned. However if government requests, I might give them parsed data for public health.
